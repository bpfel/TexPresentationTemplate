abstract = {A numerical method for solving incompressible viscous flow problems is introduced. This method uses the velocities and the pressure as variables, and is equally applicable to problems in two and three space dimensions. The principle of the method lies in the introduction of an artificial compressibility $\delta$ into the equations of motion, in such a way that the final results do not depend on $\delta$. An application to thermal convection problems is presented.},

abstract = {Though originally inspired by military applications, the advent of missile guidance and control systems has led to applications in a variety of fields -- in robotics, industrial process control, and in commercial transportation networks such as Global Positioning System technology. This book offers a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the technology behind tactical and strategic missiles and the guidance, control, and instrumentation required to reach a given "target." Topics covered include: missile aerodynamic forces and moments, the missile mathematical model, weapon delivery, GPS (Global Positioning System) and TERCOM (terrain contour matching) guidance, cruise missile mechanization equations, and a detailed analysis of ballistic missile guidance laws. The presentation assumes familiarity with calculus, ordinary differential equations, and some knowledge of modern control theory. The text is replete wuith practical examples designed to illustrate important concepts. This book will be an essential resource for students of aeronautical/aerospace engineering, as well as practicing engineers involved in the design, development, and analysis of modern aerospace guidance and control systems.},

Included are advanced methods in computational fluid dynamics, like direct and large-eddy simulation of turbulence, multigrid methods, parallel computing, moving grids, structured, block-structured and unstructured boundary-fitted grids, free surface flows. The 3rd edition contains a new section dealing with grid quality and an extended description of discretization methods. The book shows common roots and basic principles for many different methods. The book also contains a great deal of practical advice for code developers and users, it is designed to be equally useful to beginners and experts. The issues of numerical accuracy, estimation and reduction of numerical errors are dealt with in detail, with many examples. A full-feature user-friendly demo-version of a commercial CFD software has been added, which can be used to compute all flow examples from the book. All computer codes can be accessed from the publishers server on the internet.},

abstract = {We present MRAG-I2D,. 1 an open source software framework, for multiresolution simulations of two-dimensional, incompressible, viscous flows on multicore architectures. The spatiotemporal scales of the flow field are captured by remeshed vortex methods enhanced by high order average-interpolating wavelets and local time-stepping. The multiresolution solver of the Poisson equation relies on the development of a novel, tree-based multipole method. MRAG-I2D implements a number of HPC strategies to map efficiently the irregular computational workload of wavelet-adapted grids on multicore nodes. The capabilities of the present software are compared to the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, compression rates and time-to-solution. Benchmarks include the inviscid evolution of an elliptical vortex, flow past an impulsively started cylinder at Re= 40-40. 000 and simulations of self-propelled anguilliform swimmers. The results indicate that the present software has the same or better accuracy than state-of-the-art solvers while it exhibits unprecedented performance in terms of time-to-solution.},

@article{Verma2014,
abstract = {An improved bounded semi-Lagrangian scalar transport scheme based on cubic Hermite polynomial reconstruction is proposed in this paper. Boundedness of the scalar being transported is ensured by applying derivative limiting techniques. Single sub-cell extrema are allowed to exist as they are often physical, and help minimize numerical dissipation. This treatment is distinct from enforcing strict monotonicity as done by D.L. Williamson and P.J. Rasch [5], and allows better preservation of small scale structures in turbulent simulations. The proposed bounding algorithm, although a seemingly subtle difference from strict monotonicity enforcement, is shown to result in significant performance gain in laminar cases, and in three-dimensional turbulent mixing layers. The scheme satisfies several important properties, including boundedness, low numerical diffusion, and high accuracy. Performance gain in the turbulent case is assessed by comparing scalar energy and dissipation spectra produced by several bounded and unbounded schemes. The results indicate that the proposed scheme is capable of furnishing extremely accurate results, with less severe resolution requirements than all the other bounded schemes tested. Additional simulations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, with scalar timestep size unconstrained by the CFL number, show good agreement with spectral scheme results available in the literature. Detailed analytical examination of gain and phase error characteristics of the original cubic Hermite polynomial is also included, and points to dissipation and dispersion characteristics comparable to, or better than, those of a fifth order upwind Eulerian scheme. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Over the course of one semester, the team developed one rocket, entitled RORO I, and put the basis of a second rocket, entitled RORO II. Both rockets use dual-event recovery, having the drogue parachute deployed at apogee, and the main parachute deployed at approximately 450 meters AGL. As bonus features, RORO I carries advanced custom-made avionics consisting of a complete set of sensors and telemetry. The avionics is placed in the nosecone of the rocket. The nosecone is intended to be deployed at apogee in order to, firstly, let GPS acquire position during the fall-down and landing phase of the rocket, and secondly release a folded glider. The glider represents the rocket's payload that, once deployed, will need to autonomously land in a fixed perimeter. The RORO I rocket fulfilled a successful flight in Kaltbrunn, Switzerland, where recovery and structure of the rocket were tested.},
