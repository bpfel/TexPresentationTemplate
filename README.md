# Why

LaTeX presentations look nice, but setting them up is sometimes not as intuitive as in PowerPoint. The goal of this project is to define a set of environments to easily set up an educationally useful set of slides.

# What

1. Titlepage
2. Learning objectives
3. Time schedule
4. Picture slide
5. Code slide with nice listing for different languages, content aware coloring of code
6. Easy url's.

# How

This project will rely substantially on `\documentclass{beamer}` and on `\usetheme{Boadilla}`.
